# Goterpreter

A translation from Java to Go.

[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) is my reference.

Notes:
 - The error handling still reminds me a bit of how the Java version worked, which
  in my opinion is suboptimal. Finishing this takes precidence over getting it entirely
  correct, but the de facto method is sloppy in my opinion. (IE not using out of band errors.)
